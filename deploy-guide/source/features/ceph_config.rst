Configuring Ceph with Custom Config Settings
============================================

This guide assumes that the undercloud is already installed and ready
to deploy an overcloud and that the appropriate repositories
containing Ceph packages, including ceph-ansible if applicable, have
been enabled and installed as described in
:doc:`../deployment/index`.

Deploying an Overcloud with Ceph
--------------------------------

TripleO can deploy and configure Ceph as if it was a composable
OpenStack service and configure OpenStack services like Nova, Glance,
Cinder, Cinder Backup, and Gnocchi to use it as a storage backend.

Prior to Pike, TripleO deployed Ceph with `puppet-ceph`_. With the
Pike release it is possible to use TripleO to deploy Ceph with
either `ceph-ansible`_ or puppet-ceph, though puppet-ceph is
deprecated. To deploy Ceph in containers use `ceph-ansible`, for which
only a containerized Ceph deployment is possible. It is not possible
to deploy a containerized Ceph with `puppet-ceph`.

To deploy with Ceph include either of the appropriate environment
files. For puppet-ceph use "environments/puppet-ceph.yaml"
like the following::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/puppet-ceph.yaml

For ceph-ansible use "environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml"
like the following::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml

When using ceph-ansible to deploy Ceph in containers, the process
described in the :ref:`prepare-environment-containers` documentation
will configure the deployment to use the appropriate Ceph docker
image. However, it is also possible to override the default docker
image. For example::

  parameter_defaults:
    DockerCephDaemonImage: ceph/daemon:tag-stable-3.0-jewel-centos-7

In both the puppet-ceph and ceph-ansible examples above, at least one
Ceph storage node is required. The following example will configure
one Ceph storage nodes on servers matching the `ceph-storage`
profile. It will also set the default pool size, the number of times
that an object should be written for data protection, to one. These
`parameter_defaults` may be saved in an environment file
"~/my-ceph-settings.yaml" and added to the deploy commandline::

  parameter_defaults:
    OvercloudCephStorageFlavor: ceph-storage
    CephStorageCount: 1
    CephDefaultPoolSize: 1

The values above are only appropriate for a development or POC
deployment. The default pool size is three but if there are less
than three Ceph OSDs, then the cluster will never reach status
`HEALTH_OK` because it has no place to make additional copies.
Thus, a POC deployment with less than three OSDs should override the
default default pool size. However, a production deployment should
replace both of the ones above with threes, or greater, in order to
have at least three storage nodes and at least three back up copies of
each object at minimum.

Configuring nova-compute ephemeral backend per role
---------------------------------------------------

NovaEnableRdbBackend can be configured on a per-role basis allowing compute
hosts to be deployed with a subset using RBD ephemeral disk. The
remaining hosts continue using the default local ephemeral disk.

.. note::

    For best performacne images to be deployed to RBD ephemeral computes should be in RAW format while images to be deployed to local ephemeral computes should be QCOW2 format.


Generate roles_data including the provided ComputeLocalEphemeral and
ComputeRBDEphemeral roles as described in the :ref:`custom_roles`
documentation.

Configure the role counts, for example "nodes.yaml"::

    parameter_defaults:
      ComputeLocalEphemeralCount: 10
      ComputeRBDEphemeralCount: 10

Alternatively the "NovaEnableRbdBackend" parameter can be set as a role
parameter on any Compute role, for example::

    parameter_defaults:
      ComputeParameters:
        NovaEnableRbdBackend: true
      MyCustomComputeParameters:
        NovaEnableRbdBackend: false

Deploy using the per-role ceph-ansible environment file
"environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible-per-role.yaml"::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -r my_roles_data.yaml -e nodes.yaml -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible-per-role.yaml

Customizing ceph.conf with puppet-ceph
--------------------------------------

Ceph demands for more careful configuration when deployed at scale.

It is possible to override any of the configuration parameters supported by
`puppet-ceph`_ at deployment time via Heat environment files. For example::

  parameter_defaults:
    ExtraConfig:
      ceph::profile::params::osd_journal_size: 2048

will customize the default `osd_journal_size` overriding any default
provided in the `ceph.yaml static hieradata`_.

It is also possible to provide arbitrary stanza/key/value lines for `ceph.conf`
using the special `ceph::conf` configuration class. For example by using::

  parameter_defaults:
    ExtraConfig:
      ceph::conf::args:
        global/max_open_files:
          value: 131072
        global/my_setting:
          value: my_value

the resulting `ceph.conf` file should be populated with the following::

  [global]
  max_open_files: 131072
  my_setting: my_value

To specify a set of dedicated block devices to use as Ceph OSDs use
the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    ExtraConfig:
      ceph::profile::params::osds:
        '/dev/sdb':
          journal: '/dev/sde'
        '/dev/sdc':
          journal: '/dev/sde'
        '/dev/sdd':
          journal: '/dev/sde'

The above will produce three OSDs which run on `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`,
and `/dev/sdd` which all journal to `/dev/sde`. This same setup will
be duplicated per Ceph storage node and assumes uniform hardware. If
you do not have uniform hardware see :doc:`node_specific_hieradata`.

The `parameter_defaults` like the above may be saved in an environment
file "~/my-ceph-settings.yaml" and added to the deploy commandline::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/puppet-ceph.yaml -e ~/my-ceph-settings.yaml

Customizing ceph.conf with ceph-ansible
---------------------------------------

The playbooks provided by `ceph-ansible` are triggered by a Mistral
workflow. A new `CephAnsibleExtraConfig` parameter has been added to
the templates and can be used to provide arbitrary config variables
consumed by `ceph-ansible`. The pre-existing template params consumed
by the TripleO Pike release to drive `puppet-ceph` continue to work
and are translated, when possible, into their equivalent
`ceph-ansible` variable.

For example, to encrypt the data stored on OSDs use the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleExtraConfig:
      dmcrypt: true

The above example may be used to change any of the defaults found in
`ceph-ansible/group_vars`_.

If a parameter to override is not an available group variable, then
`ceph.conf` sections settings may be set directly using
`CephConfigOverrides` like the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephConfigOverrides:
      global:
        max_open_files: 131072
      osd:
        osd_journal_size: 40960

To change the backfill and recovery operations that Ceph uses to
rebalance a cluster, use an example like the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephConfigOverrides:
      global:
        osd_recovery_op_priority: 3
        osd_recovery_max_active: 3
        osd_max_backfills: 1

Tuning Ceph OSD CPU and Memory
------------------------------

The group variable `ceph_osd_docker_cpu_limit`, which corresponds to
``docker run ... --cpu-quota``, may be overridden depending on the
hardware configuration and the system needs. Below is an example of
setting custom values for this parameter::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleExtraConfig:
      ceph_osd_docker_cpu_limit: 1

.. warning:: Overriding the `ceph_osd_docker_memory_limit` variable
             is not recommended. Use of ceph-ansible 3.2 or newer is
             recommended as it will automatically tune this variable
             based on hardware.

.. admonition:: ceph-ansible 3.2 and newer
   :class: ceph

   As of ceph-ansible 3.2, the `ceph_osd_docker_memory_limit` is set
   by default to the max memory of the host in order to ensure Ceph
   does not run out of resources. While it is technically possible to
   override the bluestore `osd_memory_target` by setting it inside of
   the `CephConfigOverrides` directive, it is better to let
   ceph-ansible automatically tune this variable. Such tuning is
   also influenced by the boolean `is_hci` flag. When collocating
   Ceph OSD services on the same nodes which run Nova compute
   services (also known as "hyperconverged deployments"), set
   this variable as in the example below::

      parameter_defaults:
        CephAnsibleExtraConfig:
          is_hci: true

   When using filestore in hyperconverged deployments, include the
   "environments/tuned-ceph-filestore-hci.yaml" enviornment file to
   set a :doc:`tuned profile <tuned>` designed for Ceph filestore.
   Do not use this tuned profile with bluestore.

.. admonition:: ceph-ansible 4.0 and newer
   :class: ceph

   Stein's default Ceph is Nautilus, which introduced the Messenger v2 protocol.
   ceph-ansible 4.0 and newer added a parameter in order to:

   * enable or disable the v1 protocol
   * define the port used to bind the process

   Ceph Nautilus enables both v1 and v2 protocols by default and v1 is maintained
   for backward compatibility.
   To disable v1 protocol, set the variables as in the example below::

      parameter_defaults:
        CephAnsibleExtraConfig:
          mon_host_v1:
            enabled: False


Configure OSD settings with ceph-ansible
----------------------------------------

To specify which block devices will be used as Ceph OSDs, use a
variation of the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
      devices:
        - /dev/sdb
        - /dev/sdc
        - /dev/sdd
        - /dev/nvme0n1
      osd_scenario: lvm
      osd_objectstore: bluestore

Because `/dev/nvme0n1` is in a higher performing device class, e.g.
it is an SSD and the other devices are spinning HDDs, the above will
produce three OSDs which run on `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, and
`/dev/sdd` and they will use `/dev/nvme0n1` as a bluestore WAL device.
The `ceph-volume` tool does this by using `the "batch" subcommand`_.
This same setup will be duplicated per Ceph storage node and assumes
uniform hardware. If you do not have uniform hardware see
:doc:`node_specific_hieradata`. If the bluestore WAL data will reside
on the same disks as the OSDs, then the above could be changed to the
following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
      devices:
        - /dev/sdb
        - /dev/sdc
        - /dev/sdd
      osd_scenario: lvm
      osd_objectstore: bluestore

.. warning:: `osd_scenario: lvm` is used above to default new
             deployments to bluestore as configured, by `ceph-volume`,
             and is only available with ceph-ansible 3.2, or newer,
             and with Luminous, or newer. The parameters to support
             filestore with ceph-ansible 3.2 are backwards-compatible
             so existing filestore deployments should not simply have
             their `osd_objectstore` or `osd_scenario` parameters
             changed without taking steps to maintain both backends.

.. admonition:: Filestore or ceph-ansible 3.1 (or older)
    :class: ceph

    Ceph Luminous supports both filestore and bluestore, but bluestore
    deployments require ceph-ansible 3.2, or newer, and `ceph-volume`.
    For older versions, if the `osd_scenario` is either `collocated` or
    `non-collocated`, then ceph-ansible will use the `ceph-disk` tool,
    in place of `ceph-volume`, to configure Ceph's filestore backend
    in place of bluestore. A variation of the above example which uses
    filestore and `ceph-disk` is the following::

       parameter_defaults:
         CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
           devices:
             - /dev/sdb
             - /dev/sdc
             - /dev/sdd
           dedicated_devices:
             - /dev/nvme0n1
             - /dev/nvme0n1
             - /dev/nvme0n1
           osd_scenario: non-collocated
           osd_objectstore: filestore

    The above will produce three OSDs which run on `/dev/sdb`,
    `/dev/sdc`, and `/dev/sdd`, and which all journal to three
    partitions which will be created on `/dev/nvme0n1`. If the
    journals will reside on the same disks as the OSDs, then
    the above should be changed to the following::

       parameter_defaults:
         CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
           devices:
             - /dev/sdb
             - /dev/sdc
             - /dev/sdd
           osd_scenario: collocated
           osd_objectstore: filestore

    It is unsupported to use `osd_scenario: collocated` or
    `osd_scenario: non-collocated` with `osd_objectstore: bluestore`.

Maintaining both Bluestore and Filestore Ceph Backends
------------------------------------------------------

For existing Ceph deployments, it is possible to scale new Ceph
storage nodes which use bluestore while keeping the existing Ceph
storage nodes using filestore.

In order to support both filestore and bluestore in a deployment,
the nodes which use filestore must continue to use the filestore
parameters like the following::

   parameter_defaults:
     CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
       devices:
         - /dev/sdb
         - /dev/sdc
       dedicated_devices:
         - /dev/nvme0n1
         - /dev/nvme0n1
       osd_scenario: non-collocated
       osd_objectstore: filestore

While the nodes which will use bluestore, all of the new nodes, must
use bluestore parameters like the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleDisksConfig:
      devices:
        - /dev/sdb
        - /dev/sdc
        - /dev/nvme0n1
      osd_scenario: lvm
      osd_objectstore: bluestore

To resolve this difference, use :doc:`node_specific_hieradata` to
map the filestore node's machine unique UUID to the filestore
parameters, so that only those nodes are passed the filestore
parmaters, and then set the default Ceph parameters, e.g. those
found in `~/my-ceph-settings.yaml`, to the bluestore parameters.

An example of what the `~/my-node-settings.yaml` file, as described in
:doc:`node_specific_hieradata`, might look like for two nodes which
will keep using filestore is the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    NodeDataLookup:
      00000000-0000-0000-0000-0CC47A6EFDCC:
        devices:
          - /dev/sdb
          - /dev/sdc
        dedicated_devices:
          - /dev/nvme0n1
          - /dev/nvme0n1
        osd_scenario: non-collocated
        osd_objectstore: filestore
      00000000-0000-0000-0000-0CC47A6F13FF:
        devices:
          - /dev/sdb
          - /dev/sdc
        dedicated_devices:
          - /dev/nvme0n1
          - /dev/nvme0n1
        osd_scenario: non-collocated
        osd_objectstore: filestore

Be sure to set every existing Ceph filestore server to the filestore
parameters by its machine unique UUID. If the above is not done and
the default parameter is set to `osd_scenario=lvm` for the existing
nodes which were configured with `ceph-disk`, then these OSDs will not
start after a restart of the systemd unit or a system reboot.

The example above, makes bluestore the new default and filestore an
exception per node. An alternative approach is to keep the default of
filestore and `ceph-disk` and use :doc:`node_specific_hieradata` for
adding new nodes which use bluestore and `ceph-volume`. A benefit of
this is that there wouldn't be any configuration change for existing
nodes. However, every scale operation with Ceph nodes would require
the use of :doc:`node_specific_hieradata`. While the example above,
of making filestore and `ceph-disk` the per-node exception, requires
more work up front, it simplifies future scale up when completed. If
the cluster will be migrated to all bluestore, through node scale down
and scale up, then the amount of items in `~/my-node-settings.yaml`
could be reduced for each scale down and scale up operation until the
full cluster uses bluestore.

Customize Ceph Placement Groups per OpenStack Pool
--------------------------------------------------

The number of OSDs in a Ceph deployment should proportionally affect
the number of Ceph PGs per Pool as determined by Ceph's
`pgcalc`_. When the appropriate default pool size and PG number are
determined, the defaults should be overridden using an example like
the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephPoolDefaultSize: 3
    CephPoolDefaultPgNum: 128

In addition to setting the default PG number for each pool created,
each Ceph pool created for OpenStack can have its own PG number.
TripleO supports customization of these values by using a syntax like
the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephPools:
      - {"name": backups, "pg_num": 512, "pgp_num": 512}
      - {"name": volumes, "pg_num": 1024, "pgp_num": 1024, "rule_name": 'replicated_rule', "erasure_profile": '', "expected_num_objects": 6000}
      - {"name": vms, "pg_num": 512, "pgp_num": 512}
      - {"name": images, "pg_num": 128, "pgp_num": 128}

In the above example, PG numbers for each pool differ based on the
OpenStack use case from `pgcalc`_. The example above also passes
additional options as described in the `ceph osd pool create`_
documentation to the volumes pool used by Cinder.

Override Ansible run options
----------------------------

TripleO runs the ceph-ansible `site-docker.yml.sample` playbook by
default. The values in this playbook should be overridden as described
in this document and the playbooks themselves should not be modified.
However, it is possible to specify which playbook is run using the
following parameter::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsiblePlaybook: /usr/share/ceph-ansible/site-docker.yml.sample

For each TripleO Ceph deployment, the above playbook's output is logged
to `/var/log/mistral/ceph-install-workflow.log`. The default verbosity
of the playbook run is 0. The example below sets the verbosity to 3::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsiblePlaybookVerbosity: 3

During the playbook run temporary files, like the Ansible inventory
and the ceph-ansible parameters that are passed as overrides as
described in this document, are stored on the undercloud in a
directory that matches the pattern `/tmp/ansible-mistral-action*`.
This directory is deleted at the end of each Mistral workflow which
triggers the playbook run. However, the temporary files are not
deleted when the verbosity is greater than 0. This option is helpful
when debugging.

The Ansible environment variables may be overridden using an example
like the following::

  parameter_defaults:
    CephAnsibleEnvironmentVariables:
      ANSIBLE_SSH_RETRIES: '6'
      DEFAULT_FORKS: '25'

In the above example, the number of SSH retries is increased from the
default to prevent timeouts. Ansible's fork number is automatically
limited to the number of possible hosts at runtime. TripleO uses
ceph-ansible to configure Ceph clients in addition to Ceph servers so
when deploying a large number of compute nodes ceph-ansible may
consume a lot of memory on the undercloud. Lowering the fork count
will reduce the memory footprint while the Ansible playbook is running
at the expense of the number of hosts configured in parallel.

Applying ceph-ansible customizations to a overcloud deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------

The desired options from the ceph-ansible examples above to customize
the ceph.conf, container, OSD or Ansible options may be combined under
one `parameter_defaults` setting and saved in an environment file
"~/my-ceph-settings.yaml" and added to the deploy commandline::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml -e ~/my-ceph-settings.yaml

Already Deployed Servers and ceph-ansible
-----------------------------------------

When using ceph-ansible and :doc:`deployed_server`, it is necessary
to run commands like the following from the undercloud before
deployment::

    export OVERCLOUD_HOSTS="192.168.1.8 192.168.1.42"
    bash /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/deployed-server/scripts/enable-ssh-admin.sh

In the example above, the OVERCLOUD_HOSTS variable should be set to
the IPs of the overcloud hosts which will be Ceph servers or which
will host Ceph clients (e.g. Nova, Cinder, Glance, Gnocchi, Manila,
etc.). The `enable-ssh-admin.sh` script configures a user on the
overcloud nodes that Ansible uses to configure Ceph.

.. note::

   Both puppet-ceph and ceph-ansible do not reformat the OSD disks and
   expect them to be clean to complete successfully. Consequently, when reusing
   the same nodes (or disks) for new deployments, it is necessary to clean the
   disks before every new attempt. One option is to enable the automated
   cleanup functionality in Ironic, which will zap the disks every time that a
   node is released. The same process can be executed manually or only for some
   target nodes, see `cleaning instructions in the Ironic doc`.

.. note::

    The :doc:`extra_config` doc has a more details on the usage of the different
    ExtraConfig interfaces.

.. note::

    Deployment with `ceph-ansible` requires that OSDs run on dedicated
    block devices.


Adding Ceph Dashboard to a Overcloud deployment
------------------------------------------------

Starting from Ceph Nautilus the ceph dashboard component is available and
fully automated by TripleO.
To deploy the ceph dashboard include the ceph-dashboard.yaml environment
file as in the following example::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-dashboard.yaml

The command above will include the ceph dashboard related services and
generates all the `ceph-ansible` required variables to trigger the playbook
execution for both deployment and configuration of this component.
When the deployment has been completed the Ceph dashboard containers,
including prometheus and grafana, will be running on the controller nodes
and will be accessible using the port 3100 for grafana and 9092 for prometheus;
since this service is only internal and doesn’t listen on the public vip, users
can reach grafana using the controller provisioning network vip on the specified
port.
The resulting deployment will be composed by an external stack made by grafana,
prometheus, alertmanager, node-exporter containers and the ceph dashboard mgr
module that acts as the backend for this external stack, pushing the grafana
layouts and providing the ceph cluster specific metrics.
The grafana frontend is fully integrated with the tls-everywhere framework, hence
providing the tls environments files will trigger the certificate request for
grafana: the generated crt and key files are then passed to ceph-ansible.
This feature will also work with composable networks.
In order to isolate the monitoring access for security purposes, operators can
take advantage of composable networks and access grafana through a separate network
vip. By doing this, it's not necessary to access the provisioning network and separate
authorization profiles may be implemented.
To deploy the overcloud with the ceph dashboard composable network we need first
to generate the controller specific role created for this scenario::

    openstack overcloud roles generate -o /home/stack/roles_data.yaml ControllerStorageDashboard Compute BlockStorage ObjectStorage CephStorage

Finally, run the overcloud deploy command including the new generated `roles_data.yaml`
and the `network_data_dashboard.yaml` file that will trigger the generation of this
new network.
The final overcloud command must look like the following::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -r /home/stack/roles_data.yaml -n /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/network_data_dashboard.yaml -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml -e ~/my-ceph-settings.yaml
